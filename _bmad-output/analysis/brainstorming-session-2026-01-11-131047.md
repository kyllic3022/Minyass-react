# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** eliot
**Date:** 2026-01-11-131047

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Technical implementation plan for Android-only React Native LDR app MVP
**Goals:** Choose backend approach for instant notifications (even when app killed) and efficient realtime sync for heartbeat, status, shared note; outline Android-specific considerations.

### Context Guidance

Focus on technical approach, risks, and user experience implications.

### Session Setup

We will translate the MVP feature list into a concrete backend and realtime architecture, with special attention to Android notification delivery and app-killed behavior.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**

- **Resource Constraints:** Force a minimal stack decision for instant delivery and realtime sync under severe limits.

**Selection Rationale:** The goal is a lean, reliable backend and delivery path; this technique helps strip to essentials for an MVP that works even when the app is killed.
