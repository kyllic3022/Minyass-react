# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** eliot
**Date:** 2026-01-11-123452

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Personal Android React Native LDR app centered on passive, instant connection ("quantum entanglement")
**Goals:** Detail MVP features, UX flows, and emotional experience; capture future ideas and technical considerations.

### Context Guidance

Focus on user problems and pain points, feature ideas and capabilities, UX flow, technical approach, risks, and success metrics.

### Session Setup

We will expand the emotional core of "instant connection without typing" and refine the MVP feature set, then shape future ideas and feasibility notes.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Personal Android React Native LDR app centered on passive, instant connection ("quantum entanglement") with focus on detailed MVP features, UX flows, and emotional experience.

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Values Archaeology:** Surface the exact feelings and values the app must embody so every feature reinforces instant, wordless connection.
- **Entanglement Thinking:** Generate mechanics that feel simultaneous and mirrored across devices, aligned to the quantum metaphor.
- **Constraint Mapping:** Identify technical and emotional boundaries to keep the MVP focused and buildable.

**AI Rationale:** The session is highly personal and emotional, so we anchor in values, then ideate via the core metaphor, and finish by mapping constraints for a realistic MVP.

## Technique Execution Results

**Values Archaeology:**

- **Interactive Focus:** Emotional core of instant, passive connection without active messaging.
- **Key Breakthroughs:** The app should convey "I am thinking of you right now" as a visceral, immediate sensation.
- **User Creative Strengths:** Clear articulation of emotional intent and avoidance of chat-like interaction.
- **Energy Level:** Focused and decisive.
